One morning, Elena woke up, much like she did every day. She threw the covers on the floor and rolled out of bed, yawning hugely. She walked to the window and said, "Hello there, Mr. tree!" at the big tree in the yard. It waved its branches back at her. She walked over to her fish bowl next. "Hello there, Mr. Fish!" But wait. Where was Mr. Fish? The bowl was empty--oh, the rocks and water and tiny castle were all there alright, but the pretty blue fish with the long shiny tail was nowhere to be seen. Elena was very worried. She liked Mr. Fish very much. She looked all around her desk, but here wasn't there. Then she looked on the floor behind the desk--and there he was! He was covered in dust bunnies and not moving. Elena picked him up and put him back in the bowl. And what do you know? He shook himself off and started swimming around again!

Billy was like a king on the school yard. A king without a queen. He was the biggest kid in our grade, so he made all the rules during recess. He was a big bully. He told kids what to do, what to play, what to sing, and called them names like "Dork". He always had a smile on his face as he sat on the bench next to the big tree and watched his "kingdom". All of the other kids were scared of him. Even I was scared of him. He was mean and he could beat you up if you made him angry. Last week, a very, very stupid kid chose not to listen to Billy. Billy beat him up and Mr.Stupid Kid told the grownups that he tripped. No one would dare get Billy in trouble. Billy was mean, but he kept the school yard from getting too crazy. Well I had enough it. Billy had been picking on us for too long and we had to stop him. I grabbed some fishing line from home and brought it to school the next day. Before recess, I tied a long piece of fishing line around the tree by Billy's bench and tied the other end to a big rock. Then I went inside for class. When it was recess, Billy sat on his bench and started yelling at people. This was it. I called out, "Hey you big dummy! You're not so tough". Billy's face turned red with anger and he started marching my way. Billy marched and then tripped over the fishing line. Billy was lying face down and he seemed to be crying. Everyone cheered. The king was down.

Billy went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday. When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots. The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow. He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look.  When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.  Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food. After Billy got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef. The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars. Billy thought that it was a good deal so he went home and cooked his brother dinner. His brother was very happy with the dinner.  Billy's mom was also very happy.

The road to Grandpa's house was long and winding. There were lots of tall trees and animals in the woods. The trip took a long time because Jimmy was walking in his new boots and he wasn't used to them yet. He could have taken a ride to Grandpa's house, but that wouldn't be as fun. Jimmy liked to collect insects on the way to his Grandpa's house, so had picked the longer path. \newline\newlineAs he went along, Jimmy found more and more insects to add to his jar. His favorite was the lightning bug and he had found five of them total. He liked the moths too, but they were difficult to catch and took up a lot of space.\newline\newlineFinally, Jimmy arrived at Grandpa's house and knocked.

John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years.

Dave and John were playing catch in the living room.  Rose told them that was dumb, but she did not stop them.  She kept writing in her notebook. If they wanted to get in trouble, then they could.  It was not her responsibility.\newline\newlineDave told John to go long.  Dave did not have good aim and missed John's hands when he threw the ball.  Instead he hit the lamp and knocked it over.  He was glad he did not hit the dishes.  Nor did he hit the cat.  John was not glad that he hit the lamp, but was glad that the lamp was not broken.\newline\newlineWhen John's dad came home, he was very happy that John came clean about the lamp even when it was not broken.  After telling them off for playing inside, John's dad made them all a cake.  The cake had lemon frosting, which was Dave's favorite.  Rose cannot eat lemon, so she let Dave have her slice.  He chose to take Rose's cake home to his Bro.  Dave thanked her a lot.

Once there was a girl named Ruth, who loved to play outside whenever she could. One day, she was running around outside with a friend, but she tripped and scraped her knee very badly. She doubled over in pain, screaming for her father "DADDY!!!" she yelled, until he ran outside to help. "Thank goodness that only the skin on your knee was hurt!" he said, as he picked her up to bring her inside. "We need to cover your cut, and it looks like it was about to start raining anyway," he said. He brought her into the restroom, so he could wash the cut, then put on medicine and a large bandage. "That medicine hurt..." Ruth said, but her cut was feeling better than it did before. "Well, at least now you don't have to worry about it getting worse," her father said. "Hopefully it won't take long for your cut to get better, then you can go back to playing outside again - be careful from now on!"

A boy woke up super excited for this special day.  He could not contain his excitement knowing that the soccer final was today!  He had been working all year long to get to this day.  He quickly hopped off his bed and went to eat his breakfast.  His mom had made pancakes, waffles, and eggs, but the boy felt like eating cereal.  His mom had laid out his soccer clothes and after he was done with his breakfast, he couldn't wait to put them on.  He quickly changed into the clothes, and ran to the car where his mom was waiting for him to get in.  The ride seemed to take a long time as he was super excited to play.  The team was there and they started a small practice before the big game!  The game started and the boy was very nervous since the other team looked really good.  His team was as good too and they were tied at the end!  Everyone either got a trophy or a medal for playing in the game, and the boy got a trophy.  It was one of the best times the boy had ever had.  The day was starting to get dark and he could feel sprinkles on his hands. His parents asked the boy if he wanted to eat ice cream and pizza after the game.  The boy said he was tired and went home with his parents and he could not stop talking about how super fun the game was.  He talked and talked and talked and his parents were very proud of him.  He talked so much that he fell asleep in the car!  His dad carried him into the house and put him in his bed.  The boy had such a great day that he dreamed of soccer all night long. The trophy he had been given would let him remember about the fun day he had.

One day, my family took a vacation to the beach. We were in our car for over 10 hours but it felt like we were in the car for maybe 11, 12, or 13 hours! We thought it would only be 8 hours, but we got lost. My mom and dad were in the front seat, and my sister and I were in the back seat. My sister and I were very bored, but we had to sit still and stay quiet for a lot of the time because our dad needed to be a good driver. My sister and I played with our dolls, or we tried to play easy games. I could not read or eat in the car because I felt too sick. My sister spilled Coke on the car and my mom spanked her with a glove. The look of sadness on my sister's face almost made me cry, too! We got to the ocean so late at night, but we took a nice walk next to the ocean and then we went to bed. We were so tired from doing nothing all day! The next morning we woke up early and ran to the beach and we saw so many animals! We saw dolphins, turtles, and fish! We were hoping to see a shark, but I'm glad we did not. When it was lunch time we played with some chalk and mother made lunch. I was very happy and had a great vacation!

He was going to cook for the whole town and do it in a bear costume, which was what they did in his part of the nation to celebrate the holiday and was not weird at all. \newline\newlineUnfortunately Frank had mistaken powdered soap for sugar because the eye holes in his bear costume didn't quite match up with his own eyes. He put the whole box of soap in the strawberry punch that he meant to give to his party guests.\newline\newline"Try the punch," Frank said. \newlineSince they didn't want to be mean, after all Frank went through a lot of trouble in order to respect the town's bear costume wearing ways, the whole town drank the gross drink. No one got sick, but they were all pretty grossed out and after talking to each other planned to help Frank make the meal next year to keep it from happening again.

They read the soap box to find out if it was safe to drink.

In a zoo, many animals have claws: birds, dogs and lions. Even some monkeys have claws! One summer day, the eyes of many visitors were facing the lion cage. It was like the famous movie "The Lion King". One lion cub had been born and was drinking from its mother. There was a straw bed for the lions to sleep on, and all visitors loved to watch the baby lion cub. Well, a monkey (with claws) came into the lion's cage all of a sudden! But the lions weren't afraid, because they are kings of the animal world. Also, they had seen the movie and knew what the monkeys wanted. So it happened that the monkey took the cub from its mother into its hands. It walked over to the gate by the visitors and held up the cub for all to see! People cried. People took pictures. They were seeing the real-life 'Lion King'!

It was one week before Halloween and Thomas still needed to find the perfect costume for trick-or-treating. Last year Thomas was a scarecrow, so his mother had stuffed his clothes with straw. Thomas thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better. His friends Michael and Brianna were going as a ghost and angel, but Thomas wanted something that was both scary and real. Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items. He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth. After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him. The next day was Halloween, so Michael and Brianna came over to Thomas's house to meet him for trick-or-treating. They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, "wait for me" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. "Great costume," they thought, "we'll have to do better next year" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.

Max was a little dog that loved to ride the train. Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on.

Lucy was walking with her family in the woods, far away from the city.  Her father helped her see all kinds of animals.  It was like going to the zoo.  They saw deer, a moose, a fox, and a bear.  The bear ran away when her brother shouted.  Lucy thought that was lucky, because she was a little scared of it.  Her father showed her a whistle to blow in case she got lost.  Her brother kept stealing it.  While they were walking down by a stream, Lucy's Mom was making sandwiches for everyone.  Lucy's brother Jim kept blowing the whistle.  He told her that he was going to steal her sandwich if he got there first.  That made her mad!  She really wanted her turkey sandwich and not a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  When their mom called, they both ran back as fast as they could.  Since Jim was older, he was faster and beat her to the picnic.  Lucy started crying.  She thought Jim stole everything!

Sean the dragon liked the color green. He didn't like golden coins. They were too yellow. Every day he would go out and find green things to cover his bed of old treasure. He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried.  When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants.  They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.  One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. "What's that?" he asked.  "That's a green stone," she told him. "Sometimes my treasures have them. I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things."  "If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?" Sean asked. "Yes you can," Zarah said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire."  So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.  Soon Sean had more than enough green stones to cover his bed.  Green stones never got old and brown.  They don't catch fire either.  So, now everyone was happy.

The two girls were too excited to sit still.  They didn't even watch any cartoons before they left for the zoo in the car.  The first thing they saw was a zoo worker carrying a pail of fish.  He was going to feed the penguins.  The penguins looked funny walking on land but were very fast swimmers in the water.  Next, the girls ran to where the pandas live.

Now, he thought he was on the right way back.\newline\newlineHis headlights were not very strong. He could only see a few feet in front of him, except when the lightning hit. When the thunder came after, his squirrel, Joey, and his hamster, Broey, turned over in their sleep.\newline\newlineSuddenly, lightning and thunder hit at the same time. There was a bright light and a crunching sound. A tree fell in front of the car!\newline\newlineSam hit the brakes. The car slowed down and stopped, and he got out. Sam walked up to the tree.

There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.  The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets.

Molly and her friend Jessica liked to play hide and go seek in the woods.  They would almost always play in the woods behind Molly's house. They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill. The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!

He had spent all of his life under water with his friends, a blow fish named Joey, a sponge named Pam, a star fish named Elaine, and another octopus, Stacey.

It was time for Jill to make her famous apple pie, out of the yellow apples that grew on her land. It was not time to pick the red cherries, or the orange oranges or even the green lettuce, but their nice colors made Jill happy. She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking. A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies. She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour. She would have to go to the store to get some, since you can't make a pie without flour. While she was at the store, she would also buy some cheese, bread, and milk. She did not need these to make pie, but she did need them to make her dinner. At the store Jill ran into her friends Bob and Steve and George, and told them she would make them all pies. After she had finished her shopping, Jill went to the library to get some books, to the car wash to wash her car, and to her mother's house to say hello. She went home after, and made her yummy pies.

One morning Julie took her dog, Rosie, for a walk. Rosie loved to walk outside. She loved to walk any time - morning, afternoon, or night. She liked to smell everything. This morning she smelled something new. It was another animal. It was not a squirrel. It was not another dog. Maybe it was a tiger! Rosie sniffed around until she saw the other animal. It was not a tiger. It was a cat. The cat was watching Rosie. The cat was afraid Rosie would try to bite her, so she climbed up a tree. Rosie tried to follow her, but she could not climb up. Instead, she barked at the cat in the tree. Julie did not want Rosie to scare the cat. She called Rosie away from the tree. The cat watched them walk away. When they came back, the cat was gone.

Ralph was an alligator that loved to splash around in the water. Ralph had three brothers, named Henry, Larry, and Thomas. But none of Ralph's three brothers liked to play in the water.

Joey went to the doctor yesterday. He was a little scared because he might have to get a shot, but his mother promised that it wouldn't hurt. During the time they were in the waiting room, Joey played with some blue and green blocks and some toy cars that the doctor kept there for the children who came to see him. He also met another little boy named Bobby who also had to see the doctor. Bobby liked playing with the cars more than the blocks, but Joey liked playing with both of them. Joey also met a little girl named Sandy who was playing with some dolls the doctor also had for the children. When it was Joey's turn to see the doctor, his mother led him into one of the rooms and had him sit on a yellow chair. The doctor was a friendly man who wore glasses. He took Joey's temperature and looked in his ears, then asked him a few questions about how he had been feeling. When Joey said his throat hurt a little, the doctor took a look at it as well. He said everything looked okay, and Joey wouldn't need any shots this visit. On the way out Susan the nurse let Joey take a red lollipop from a basket on her desk.

Once there was a guy who lived in a giant red mitten. He was always mad because the old woman in the shoe down the road got all the attention for living in a giant piece of clothing. One day he made a plan to play a joke. \newline\newlineHe took a cookie and with it in his hand went to dig a hole under the old lady's shoe. When he finished digging he hid the cookie in the hole and then went to the zoo. He stole a bunch of monkeys which he took back to the lady's shoe house. The TV news team was talking to her on camera that day outside her house about how great she was for living in a shoe and how smart and cool she was. \newline\newlineThe guy stood there listening with his bag of hungry monkeys. At the very second the news team took a close up of the shoe with their big camera the guy opened the bag and freed the monkeys.

Steve had a very long finger. It was the longest finger anyone in his town had. One day Steve shut the toilet seat, and his finger got caught in it. He couldn't get it out. It was very cold in the bathroom. This is why his sister brought him a coat. He was in the bathroom a long time. So, Steve started pasting a stone on the wall with glue on the end of his brush. Then he wrote the truth on this stone. He used a black pencil to write the truth on this stone, but the writing turned out blue. He did not know that his sister was watching him write the truth from the ceiling. He was upset because he always had a fear that he would have to share his secret power with his sister.

Every day at noon, when it was time for recess, Mrs. Snooter would honk a loud horn. This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.\newline\newlineThe students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.\newline\newlineFirst, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.\newline\newlineIf a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym.

Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students.

Every day at noon, when it was time for recess, Mrs. Snooter would honk a loud horn. This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.\newline\newlineThe students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.\newline\newlineFirst, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.\newline\newlineIf a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.\newline\newlineFinally, there was a long run to the seesaw.

Will was playing his favorite song.  The song was about a flower.  Will stopped singing and went outside.  A single star was out in the night sky.  Will got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.  He also had jam with it.  He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.  Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.  Will walked over to the living room.

I once went on a week-long backpacking trip through the mountains. We had a lot of fun and saw a lot of animals. We saw two bears on the first. We also saw one buffalo. During the week we climbed four different mountains. The best day of the trip was the last day. On the last day we heard that one of best things to do was to climb the last mountain at night so that way you could watch the sunrise on top of the mountain. We had to wake up at two in the morning to do the climb. It was very tough to climb a mountain at night. We finally got to the top of the mountain at five in the morning. We watched the sunrise an hour later at six in the morning. It was very beautiful. In fact, at one time because of the rise of the mountain you it was daytime in front of us and nighttime behind us. This was one of the best times in my life.

There once was an alligator named Albert (who wore an office shirt). He had two good friends - Lock the cat and Gary the hamster. Gary often rode around in Albert's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with Albert and Lock as they walked around. One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather. "If we don't get out of this soon, I might die!" yelled Gary, who was cold. "Don't worry, no one's going to die!" yelled Albert, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary. Luckily, they found a house after leaving the forest, which happened to be near the ocean. They ran inside, and dried off, before they headed to sleep.

There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted.

There once was a boy named Kevin.  He met Jessica one afternoon at a park on a hot summer day.  They both started talking and became great friends.  They spent the whole day together and ate their lunches together next to the pond.  Kevin sure enjoyed the park more than he liked going to the beach or store.  There were many ducks, frogs, birds and chipmunks playing around the pond.  In fact, one of the chipmunks even came up and stole Kevin's car keys when he was eating!  Kevin knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.  In seconds, the chipmunk came out with the keys and dropped them in front of Kevin right before grabbing the chip and running back into the hole.  The chipmunk then went in to have his snack and left Kevin and Jessica alone.

The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down. After what seemed like hours, Sally spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close! Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. Sally and Jared both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors! Jared always got chocolate, because that was Dad's favorite flavor, too. Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather. Sally couldn't choose. She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out. Finally she chose the shop's special flavor "Tropical Turtle". The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach.

While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter Tina, we saw an ice cream truck pull up on the street. "Can we get ice cream, Nana?" asked Tina. "Sure we can!" I answered. As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. "Nana, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!" Laughing at what was said, I answered, "If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!" Once we reached the ice cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda. "Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?" she asked. "If that is what you want, you sure can!" I answered. We got our food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who Tina knew from her kindergarten class. "Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?" "Let's go!" We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. "That is okay", she said, "Butterflies need to be left out to fly free".  Mary asked Tina if she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead of going home. So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both tired after a long day. We needed to get a good night's sleep to enjoy our camping trip tomorrow.

In the year 2037, one brave man named Hugo wanted to travel to Etopit to see the farm. On Earth, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses. Hugo wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to Earth. Hugo was no normal man. He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air. Hugo put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend Ralph tickle his nose for 7 hours. Hugo sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in Etopit. The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume. Hugo met Rufus and Xenon, 2 of the most power squirrels in space. He told them his name was Tiddlywink, and that he was sent by the squirrel king from Etopit's moon Rebeti to help them grow even more oranges. Rufus and Xenon told him all their secrets.

Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and I don't know what to get him. He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, Tim and Tom, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.\newline\newlineMy mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together.

Jamey really wanted a pet dog, so he went to ask his parents.\newline\newline"Mom, Dad, can I we get a dog?"\newline\newlineJamey's mom and dad thought about this, and then answered him. \newline\newline"Having a pet can be a lot of work, Jamey. When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog."\newline\newlineJamey was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first. \newline\newline"This dog is pretty big, Jamey," his father said. "He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have."  \newline\newlineJamey thought that Dad was right about that. The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog.

Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?"\newline\newlineJamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over.\newline\newline"Do you like the brown dog?" asked Jamey's dad.\newline\newline"Yes!" said Jamey. "Can we get him?"\newline\newline"Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?" asked Jamey's mom.\newline\newline"I promise," said Jamey.\newline\newline"In that case, I guess we have a dog!"\newline\newlineThis made Jamey very happy.

Sam wanted a phone, so he asked his Mom if he could have one because phones are very expensive. Sam told his Mom that he could do extra chores for money to buy one. Sam's Mom told him that a phone is very expensive, much more expensive than the toys he normally buys with his chore money. But Sam still really wanted a phone. Sam's Mom came up with an idea and told Sam to pray for one. Since she could not help him, maybe God could help him. That night Sam prayed before bed and asked if he could somehow have a phone. The next day Sam was playing bat and ball with his brother John and sister Lucy. He saw something shine from the ground. He found a phone lying there. He ran and took it to his Mom who checked the phone, and after a quick clean found the phone worked. She told Sam that someone must have lost the phone and she'll call them to tell them they have found the phone. Sam sat in the kitchen as Sam's Mom called the number in the phone.

Today was an important day for Sam: he was going to go to the pet store and pick out a pet to take home and live with him! Sam was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him. The pet store had a big, white door and Sam opened it up and heard lots of barking! He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was Chris. Sam said hello and petted the dogs. He really liked one of the dogs named Rocky, but Rocky did not like him. Chris said that Rocky was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice. Sam was a little sad, but he saw the next cage! There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named Button. Sam put his finger through the bars in Button's cage and Button licked his fingers. Sam laughed, and asked Chris to let him play with Buttons. Sam and Buttons played together in the grass outside of the store, and Sam was so happy. Buttons loved Sam, and Sam loved Buttons! Sam had some papers that he had to sign, and he showed Chris all of the toys and items he had bought to bring home with his new pet: Chris was so happy, too! Sam put his new friend on a leash and took Buttons home with him, and they loved each other very much.

Max is a very happy cow. He's dark brown, with big blue eyes, and a soft pink nose.  He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.  During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn. \newline\newlineThe hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. "What is this?" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.  \newline\newline"It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house. \newline\newline"It's so pretty!" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. "Oh! It's so chilly!" He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits. He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer. \newline\newline"Max! What are you doing out here?" The farmer, named Bob, asked. He was loud, but not mad. "It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!"

As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. \newline\newlineThat night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.\newline\newlineThe next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.

Linda was very excited when she woke up this morning. It was finally the last day of school and she was going to get the whole summer off. She was so excited because this summer she and her family would be traveling to France. She had always wanted to visit Europe after her friend Susan visited Spain and Italy the summer before and came back knowing all sorts of funny words. She was going to get to see the Eiffel Tower, try all kinds of new food, and meet a whole bunch of new people. She was a bit worried because she didn't speak any French. She wanted to meet some of the people there and become friends. She didn't know how well that would work if she couldn't talk with them. Overall she was still quite excited. She would miss seeing her friends at home this summer. If she were in France she would miss the happy days of playing baseball with Tommy and Susan or going to movies to hide from the heat with her good friend Lilly, or getting lost wandering in the woods behind her house. Oh well, it was time to get ready for school, she would have to enjoy this last day with them before heading out on her adventure.

Jon woke up knowing that today was finally the day.  It was his birthday!  He had been waiting for this day all year long.  He was super excited to get all his presents and hoped he finally got the basketball he wanted.  As he ran outside, he saw his parents weren't even awake yet!  He looked at the clock and it was still only six in the morning.  He tried to wake up his parents, but they told him to go back to sleep.  Jon went back to his bed and laid there until it was finally time to open presents.  His parents were brushing their teeth and taking a shower, so Jon waited outside where the presents were.  He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.  He had really hoped there was a basketball.  The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.  The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.  Jon was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!  He wished and wished with all his might for a basketball.  The last box was a square shape.  If it was a basketball, surely it would have been round!  He opened the box and saw that it really was a basketball!  His parents had put it in a box so it wouldn't be clear.  He was so happy he hugged his parents and told them thank you.  His parents brought the cake out and he ate cake, holding on to his basketball the whole time. There was pizza and ice cream and chips, but Jon was too full and wanted to play with his new ball right away!

There was once a little fairy named Twinkles who lived in an old willow tree. The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, "Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry."\newline\newline"Do not worry," said Twinkles. "I am going to wait here for you until you get back."\newline\newlineWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. "Hmm," thought Twinkles, "I wonder where Betsy went off to." Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.\newline\newlineSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. "Help me! I'm stuck!" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \newline\newline"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.\newline\newline"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river.

It was Saturday and it was nice outside. I did not have school and my mom did not have work. When I woke up we ate breakfast and got ready for the day. My mom started to clean up the house so I went up to my room to play with my toys. My mom came upstairs and told me, "If you clean up your room there is a great surprise in it for you." I was very excited about what the surprise was but not very excited to clean my room. My mom left and closed the door. I looked around and saw how messy my room was. And I really did not want to clean it. So what I did was pick up all my stuff in my room and put it all in my closet. It did not take me very long so I hung out in my room for a little bit longer before heading downstairs to the basement to tell my mom I was ready for my surprise. She came upstairs to see how I did and immediately saw what I did. She was not happy about it. She said, "You either do it right, or Ill do it right and you won't get a surprise." That was enough to make me clean my room right. Finally, my mom told me the surprise when I was all finished. She told me we were going out to the park! But by the time we got there, I could only play for a little bit before it started getting dark. I wished I would have cleaned my room right the first time so I had more time at the park.

Today is the big day, today is Saturday and it is my birthday party.  I turned 7 on Thursday, but I wanted my party on the weekend.  All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.  We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!  The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.  Bob made us all laugh a lot.  After the clown left we all played fun games.  We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.  There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.  After that, my mom came out with my cake.  It was chocolate with chocolate icing!  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too. We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could. I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool, but it was too cold.  My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick.  It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about.  After cake all my friends had to leave except for Timmy.  Timmy's mom said he could sleep over so we made a fort inside and told ghost stories.  My birthday party was the best day of my life.

Jim wanted to make a fun meal one day. After thinking about it for a long time, he chose to make a chicken dish. Jim made a trip to the store to collect all of the different things he would need to make this meal. He drove his blue truck to the store. On the way he passed a green car, a red van, and a yellow bus. When he got to the store, he met his friends Bob & Mark. He asked if they had seen his friend Joe, but they said no. At the store, Jim bought two pieces of chicken, tomato sauce, cheese, and bread. He drove back to the house, but he saw that something was missing. He had forgotten to grab the bag with the bread in it. He drove back to the store, apologized to the clerk, and grabbed his bag with the bread inside. When he got home, he began to get the food ready. It took him an hour to get the chicken ready to cook and the oven heated up. After that, it took him another hour to cook the food. He had to wait another hour after it was done cooking for his dinner guests to arrive. When they finally arrived, everyone told Jim how wonderful the food tasted, and everyone at the table asked for seconds.

I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me. I was pretty little at the time, so I believed her with no question. It made me think that the bank was important. It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness. I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it.\newline\newlineI didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry.\newline\newline\newlineMy mother came in at the sound of the crash. \newline"I'm so, so sorry!" I cried. "I broke the bank! I broke the family bank!"\newline"What, Sarah?" my mother asked, kneeling next to me on the floor. "The what?"\newline"The bank! Aunt Tracy said it was in the family for years!"\newline"What, this? We got it for you at a garage sale when you were two. It was fifty cents."

A rabbit was hopping around, following all the smells he could smell. He had a great nose, smelling carrots, bushes, flowers, and other animals. He smelled melons and he smelled a dish of ice cream. Rabbits don't like ice cream, so he moved to the flowers faster. And he didn't really like to snack on melons either. He saw friends, the duckling and the mother duck, but he was moving too fast to get to the flowers. He could smell the flowers from a long way away. He kept hopping to reach them, faster and faster. One hop, two hops, three hops. On his third hop he always bounced a little higher. He finally smelled the flowers close, so he hopped a little bit faster. The flowers were in sight. He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before. A wonderful smell at last.

One hop, two hops, three hops. On his third hop he always bounced a little higher. He finally smelled the flowers close, so he hopped a little bit faster. The flowers were in sight. He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before. A wonderful smell at last.

Corky walked to the store to buy some milk, like he does every Tuesday. On his way, he passed the red house where John lives, the green house where June lives, the white house where Barack lives, the blue hat store, and the orange house where Jessie lives. He finally reached the store at 5 o'clock. \newline\newlineCorky thought about buying some other things too. He looked at the potato chips, but didn't like the flavors they had left. All of the normal flavored ones were gone. He never liked hard candy, so he ignored those. He saw the apples, but didn't need one because he had apples at home. So he picked out some cookies instead. Corky thought he'd eat them on his way home. He waited in line until it was his turn, and then paid Abe the cashier. Abe gave him his change and wished him a good day.\newline\newlineOn his way home, Corky ate his cookies. He had hoped to buy peanut butter cookies, but the store never has those. Instead, he bought sugar cookies. He liked them very much too, so he wasn't at all upset. When he got home, he poured a glass of milk and finished his cookies.

His parents were out and dropped him at the babysitter's house at 12 o'clock. Lunchtime had past, but later the babysitter fixed him a dinner of some kind of brown meat. Under the meat was a slice of dry toast. Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza. Even if it wasn't what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.\newline  \newlineTimmy was bored and wanted something to do, but he didn't have any toys. All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste. He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train. The house was quiet and nighttime was near. He pretended he was camping. It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.  \newline\newlineHe looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful. If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he didn't even have a pencil. \newline\newlineTimmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat.

The cat woke up from its nap under the couch. Poking his head out from under the couch, there were no dogs there. He walked out from under the couch and stretched out his paws along the hard wood floor. Far outside there was some barking from the dogs, but he was safe from them for now. The smell of tuna was in the air and the cat followed the scent to the kitchen. A woman was making a tuna sandwich for her two kids. When she finished, she put the tuna can on to the floor.

He saw a pumpkin name Sue using toothpaste, a cat name Walt watching a movie and a bear name Phil cooking on a grill. On his drive back home he saw a rat name Randy, and a lion name Leo riding a bike. When the doggy got back home he wanted to write a book about all of the things that he saw.

Ashley woke up bright and early on Friday morning during summer.  Her birthday was only a day away, and her parents had promised her a trip to the fair as her present the next day!  She thought it was going to be quite a treat.  She skipped down the stairs to see her mom making a chocolate cake on the stove.  "You run along outside to go play with your friends," her mom told her, "I can get everything ready for your special lunch on my own."  \newlineWhen Ashley made it outside, she found her friend Katherine playing in the dirt.

I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel. The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides. My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake. The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it. There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake. Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy. One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot. That cut hurt and made me sad. The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut. Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals. There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers. Their favorite thing to eat is ham. After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream. Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me. Christopher also likes feeding the animals. His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel.

There once was a small boy who liked to wiggle.  He would wiggle everywhere he went. He would wiggle during supper when he was eating his food.  He would wiggle down the winding path outside his house. He could wiggle his right knee when he walked, and that gave his wiggle even more wiggle.\newline\newlineOne day, his grandpa was watching the boy wiggle.  His grandpa was old and liked to cough.  He had a long beard that was grey at the top. He was tired of watching the boy wiggle, and thought the boy was wiggling around a little too much. So, his grandpa gave the boy a pea and told him it was a magic pea. He said the magic pea would stop his wiggle. The boy started roaring with laughter. He didn't believe a pea could stop his wiggle.  The grandpa put the pea in a little square bag and tied it around the boy's waist.\newline\newlineThe boy tried to wiggle, but he couldn't wiggle at all. All he could do was walk straight.

It's finally the weekend of Halloween and I get to dress up in my lion costume.  Halloween is my favorite holiday because I really like candy and love dressing up.  Last year I was a ghost, but this year I am a lion.  My little brother is dressed like a dinosaur and he keeps chewing on everything.  He is only 3 years old so I guess that is okay.  His name is Todd and his favorite holiday is his birthday but I don't think he knows much about any of them.  My dad loves Christmas and my Mom really likes Thanksgiving.  But I love Halloween.   We have to wait for my dad to come home from work so we can go out and trick-or-treat.  While we are waiting my mommy cooks us dinner.  She wants us to eat good food before we spoil our dinner with all the candy we are going to get.  I can't wait to go to my friend Kevin's house.  His parents give the best candy and give me extra since Kevin is my friend.  I think Kevin said he was going to dress up like a pirate but I don't remember.  I don't think pirates are very cool, but I didn't tell Kevin that.  I think I hear my dad coming up the stairs.  Tonight is going to be the best Halloween ever.

All the Grizzly bears felt excitement at the arrival of their new shirts; everyone except Truman, he was a very unhappy bear who didn't like to wear clothing. He also hated tying his shoes and matching his socks. These were all things Truman didn't like doing.  So when the Grizzly bear king held a town meeting to pass out all the shirts, Truman stole the microphone and sang a song to express his feelings: "I won't wear those shirts you bear bosses, I won't wear my socks. I have all the fur I need, don't put me in a shirt box. I want to scratch the ground with my claws, and feel the wild wind; If you all make me wear, then my darlings as a bear, I think I'll smash you with my paws, and chew off all your skins."

Once there was a dog named Noodle. Noodle had two brothers named Puff and Fluff, and a sister named Polly. Noodle's best friend was a boy named Jack. Jack went to school, but the dogs stayed home all day. Jack liked to feed Noodle chicken and beef. One day Jack went to the store and bought chicken for Noodle. Jack put too much chicken in Noodle's bowl. Noodle ate up all the chicken, but then his belly hurt. Poor Noodle! Jack was sad that he had made Noodle feel sick. Jack took Noodle, Puff, and Fluff to the park to run and play. Polly stayed home because she was sick. There were so many things to see at the park. Puff found a little red ladybug. Fluff found a big gray mouse. Noodle found a long brown stick. Jack found a deep pond with three ducks in it. Everyone had a great day at the park. Then the three dogs and Jack all went back home. When they got home, Polly was asleep on the bed. Polly said she was feeling better. Jack brought Polly some chicken noodle soup to eat. Noodle, Puff, and Fluff sat on the bed with Polly eating bones and drinking milk.

The day was dark and stormy; puddles could be seen all over the ground, making the yard look like a tiny pond.  Conner frowned as he let the curtain drop back down. There was no way that mommy was going to let him go out and play today. She would say that it was too muddy and he would get wet. Conner thought to himself, "But what if I don't ask her?"  Smiling, Conner pushed open the sliding door to the back yard.  Slipping on his rain boots, he rushed outside and began to run and jump from puddle to puddle, sending large showers of water up around him with every jump. After he had jumped in all of the puddles he looked back towards the house to find mommy standing in the doorway watching him with a smile on her face. She giggled as she too pulled on her rain boots and joined him in jumping from puddle to puddle.

Zebras cannot clap. However, one weekend a magic clown wiggled his nose and said a few magical words and a zebra could clap. This zebra lived in a zoo with many other zebras. This zebra's name was John, John the Zebra. John was so excited that he could clap. He tried to clap as much as he could. He had trouble understanding when and what to clap.

Soon the children would wake up and run out the front door with their books for school. Inside, the tooth fairy would be wondering what was keeping him. "It's too dangerous to stay at this door," the elf thought, "The children might see me." \newline\newlineJust then he heard the alarm clocks go off inside.

Janice spent the weekend at a family party in Moore, Georgia. While she was there, she played with her cousin Justine. The two of them rode tricycles, shared presents, and bought their favorite gum together. Janice's favorite part of the weekend was swimming in the lake with Justine and her dog, Boots. Boots did not like the water at first, but soon was splashing around with them. His favorite thing to do was fetch sticks from the water. They also went on a fast boat around the lake.

There was once a leprechaun named Tony who spent his days at the end of a rainbow guarding his golden bowl of cereal. Tony was one of the toughest leprechauns in all the land, so no one dared to mess with him or try to take his bowl. That is, until an angel named Jess fell from Heaven. Jess had broken her wing, so she had no choice but stay on Earth, and could not return to the sky. So she chose to make the best of it and went to see all of the beautiful and interesting things on Earth. One day, she came across Tony's rainbow, and was amazed by it. She followed the rainbow to the end, wondering what could be there. Then she saw it: Tony's golden bowl. From the time she saw the bowl, she knew she wanted it.  She had heard about how tasty cereal was when she lived in Heaven, but she never tried it for herself. When she went to have some of the cereal, Tony the Leprechaun popped out from behind the rainbow and laughed at her. "Don't you know," he said, "that I'm the toughest leprechaun in all the land? What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?" The angel saw that he was right, and she couldn't argue with him. So she left to find something to trade. She came across a seesaw which looked very interesting. She thought that Tony might like it, so she brought the seesaw to his rainbow and said, "I've come bearing a seesaw."

I didn't want to tell him that my roots were hidden in the library!\newline\newlineI walked over to him to pick this little kid up to get him to quiet down about the bean roots, well, he got me with his little knife and I dropped him! Thankfully, he didn't get hurt or I would've been so sad! \newline\newlineHe ran down the beanstalk when I chased after him. I guess he wanted to get back to his little people. I didn't follow him, but I sure hope he doesn't come back for my stuff.

To the restroom
To get the goose
To play the golden guitar
Down the beanstalk and to the little people world.

When Timmy got to his grandma's house, she was standing at the door waiting for him. She had a plate of cookies in her hands and was very excited to see him. \newline\newline"Hi, Timmy!"

I had always had fun playing in the dirt growing up, digging, throwing, building, smashing, everything, so this year for my birthday my mom and dad had bought me a gardening kit to grow my own vegetables. It came with a watering pot, a shovel, a rake and seeds! The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden. We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel, put a seed or two in each hole, and covered them up with dirt and raked over them. Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes. Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten. Every day they would get even bigger. That was the most exciting part! Then they started making little tomatoes, and they sort of looked like grapes. And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red. This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner.

I couldn't believe today had come! It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store. First off, let me say that my name is Lilly, and as I'm sure you know, today's my birthday! Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me. Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets. I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!\newline\newline\tabI arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right. Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day. It was everything I ever hoped and I can't wait for tomorrow!
-  multiple: Which of the following is Lilly afraid of?
Snakes
Lizards

I once was walking in the woods with my friends. The day was very nice, there were a lot of trees. The walk was part of a week long trip I took with Boy Scouts. This day was day number three of our trip. There was four of us walking. We were walking down a path when all of the sudden we came across a bear. This scared us. Bears can be dangerous. A few seconds later we saw another bear, there was not only one. This bear was a baby bear. A leader told us that a bear with a baby can be much more dangerous. We had to remember what to do when you come across a bear. The leader told us not to walk towards the bear. You also can not make any quick motions. The leader said we needed to start talking to make noise and to start to walk away from the bears. After a little bit of time we were away from the bears and we were safe.

At the farm, the farmer found that he needed to go to the town to get some tools.  He needed to pick up five things at the store.

One summer when I was sixteen, I planted a vegetable garden. I wanted a bunch of different vegetables, so I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two cucumber plants. My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants. I watered the garden daily with a watering can. When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back. About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day. I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over. Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week. I didn't know what to do with the zucchini so I gave some to my neighbor. I gave some to my parents to take to their friends. Then I went door to door and gave zucchini to everyone in the neighborhood.

There was once an alligator who liked to wear orange sweaters. He liked that is was orange instead of a boring color like white or black. All of the other alligators would laugh and point at him and say mean things about him. They would say it was silly for an alligator to wear a sweater. One night it got very cold and the ground was very hard. The alligator rested well with his sweater to keep his tummy warm and protected from the cold ground. After that night all of the alligators wore different colored sweaters (red, blue, green, and yellow) and were safe and warm from the cold weather. They thanked him and apologized for laughing before. The point of this story is that sometimes silly ideas turn out to be the best ideas and we shouldn't make fun of others.

Dig, being the ever helpful turtle, took the splinter in his mouth and tugged it. The splinter popped right out of Rudd's paw and flew right into the air and then landed in the middle of the river.\newline\newlineRudd looked happy and gave Dig a hug. "Thank you so much, Dig! And for helping me, I'll give you the choice of one of these three desserts I found. What would you like to have? A cake? A cookie? Or maybe this brownie?"\newline\newline"Oh, Rudd, you are so silly and know you don't even have to ask me which one I'd take. You know I love brownies!" Dig smiled happily as Rudd gave him his treat and another hug for helping with the splinter.\newline\newlineAfter the two friends finish their dessert, Dig helped Rudd put up the rest of his fence until the sun went down that day. It was a good day for both friends.

One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach.  We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it. \newline\newlineWe piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no.  I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip. \newline\newlineWhen we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water. \newline\newlineIt felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.\newline\newlineWhen I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.\newline\newlineWhen we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately. It was a very good day that I'll always remember.

As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.\newline\newlineWhen I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.\newline\newlineWhen we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately. It was a very good day that I'll always remember.
-  multiple: What was it that was added to a collection at home?
Shells.
Fish.
Buckets.
Seaweed.

Bill's parents, Ned and Susan, came into his room. They told him not to be scared. They said they were going to make sure the car windows were shut and they would be back soon. Bill said okay.

This summer Frank and his friends went to Boy Scout camp for two weeks. At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories. At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.\newline\newlineAt first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys.
