One morning, Elena woke up, much like she did every day. She threw the covers on the floor and rolled out of bed, yawning hugely. She walked to the window and said, "Hello there, Mr. tree!" at the big tree in the yard. It waved its branches back at her. She walked over to her fish bowl next. "Hello there, Mr. Fish!" But wait. Where was Mr. Fish? The bowl was empty--oh, the rocks and water and tiny castle were all there alright, but the pretty blue fish with the long shiny tail was nowhere to be seen. Elena was very worried. She liked Mr. Fish very much. She looked all around her desk, but here wasn't there. Then she looked on the floor behind the desk--and there he was! He was covered in dust bunnies and not moving. Elena picked him up and put him back in the bowl. And what do you know? He shook himself off and started swimming around again!

Billy was like a king on the school yard. A king without a queen. He was the biggest kid in our grade, so he made all the rules during recess. He was a big bully. He told kids what to do, what to play, what to sing, and called them names like "Dork". He always had a smile on his face as he sat on the bench next to the big tree and watched his "kingdom". All of the other kids were scared of him. Even I was scared of him. He was mean and he could beat you up if you made him angry. Last week, a very, very stupid kid chose not to listen to Billy. Billy beat him up and Mr.Stupid Kid told the grownups that he tripped. No one would dare get Billy in trouble. Billy was mean, but he kept the school yard from getting too crazy. Well I had enough it. Billy had been picking on us for too long and we had to stop him. I grabbed some fishing line from home and brought it to school the next day. Before recess, I tied a long piece of fishing line around the tree by Billy's bench and tied the other end to a big rock. Then I went inside for class. When it was recess, Billy sat on his bench and started yelling at people. This was it. I called out, "Hey you big dummy! You're not so tough". Billy's face turned red with anger and he started marching my way. Billy marched and then tripped over the fishing line. Billy was lying face down and he seemed to be crying. Everyone cheered. The king was down.

Billy went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday. When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots. The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow. He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look.  When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.  Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food. After Billy got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef. The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars. Billy thought that it was a good deal so he went home and cooked his brother dinner. His brother was very happy with the dinner.  Billy's mom was also very happy.

Scott Alan woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house. He felt something licking his face and he wasn't sure what it was. As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp! He was licked again!\newline\newline"Oh, Boscoe!" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way.\newline\newlineOne of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. \newline\newlineAll of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, "Boscoe!" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river!\newline\newlineAs Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. \newline\newline"Boy, was that close!" Scott yelled out loud!\newline\newlineThat was the best adventure ever!

It was a hot Saturday afternoon, and James was going shopping with his mother. While she made her shopping list, James looked out the window. In the sky, he saw pretty birds. He smiled - James liked birds. He saw one last Friday when he was getting muddy in the puddles, and another on Wednesday when he was playing with his toy spaceship.\newline\newlineOnce his mother was done making her list, James got his shoes on before getting in the car. "Should I bring my jacket, Mom?" he asked. \newline\newline"No," his mother answered, fixing his hair, "it is warmer today than it was yesterday, in fact, it's hot!"\newlineJames and his mother got in the car, and drove off to the store. He leaned his head on the car window, looking at the animals and trees they passed. He saw flowers, a puppy, ants, and people walking, and even a chipmunk! \newline\newlineWhen they got to the store, James and his mother grabbed an empty shopping cart. James always liked helping his mother do her shopping - she sometimes let him get a treat if he was good. They went up and down the aisles, picking up the things on the list, including James' favorite food - peanut butter - and James was very well behaved.\newlineAs they finished their shopping and walked to the front of the store in order to pay, James' mother said, "James, you can get a candy bar if you'd like, so I can say 'thank you' for being a super good helper today."\newline\newlineJames was so excited. He picked one with peanuts and chocolate, and placed it with the rest of their items. \newline\newlineWhen they got home, James spent the rest of the day playing Legos in his room. It was a good day.

Once upon a time, there was an old man named John. John loved to eat peaches. In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.

One day, my family took a vacation to the beach. We were in our car for over 10 hours but it felt like we were in the car for maybe 11, 12, or 13 hours! We thought it would only be 8 hours, but we got lost. My mom and dad were in the front seat, and my sister and I were in the back seat. My sister and I were very bored, but we had to sit still and stay quiet for a lot of the time because our dad needed to be a good driver. My sister and I played with our dolls, or we tried to play easy games. I could not read or eat in the car because I felt too sick. My sister spilled Coke on the car and my mom spanked her with a glove. The look of sadness on my sister's face almost made me cry, too! We got to the ocean so late at night, but we took a nice walk next to the ocean and then we went to bed. We were so tired from doing nothing all day! The next morning we woke up early and ran to the beach and we saw so many animals! We saw dolphins, turtles, and fish! We were hoping to see a shark, but I'm glad we did not. When it was lunch time we played with some chalk and mother made lunch. I was very happy and had a great vacation!

One upon a time there was a dragon named Jack.  He was large and had big scales, but did not have claws or a mean look on his face like other dragons did.  He also didn't have wings and couldn't fly.  Jack lived near a castle that had a princess trapped in it.  This castle looked and was guarded by an evil dragon named Ryan. The castle was old and dirty.  It wasn't clean or special like many castles are thought to look.  One day Jack thought that he was going to try to save the princess Linda when Ryan was sleeping that night.  After sunset, he slowly walked around and climbed over the back wall.  After passing many sleeping guards, Jack put his nose near the princess's tower window. She climbed out on to it and they ran off.  During their escape, Ryan woke up and started chasing them.

They had fun barking at many things. They barked at squirrels. They barked at a bus. They barked at the mailman. They barked at a weird bug. They barked so much, they were never quiet! The neighbor was a grumpy old man. His name was Bert. Bert threw a shoe at them because they were barking too much. He couldn't take a nap because they were so loud.

Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items. He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth. After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him. The next day was Halloween, so Michael and Brianna came over to Thomas's house to meet him for trick-or-treating. They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, "wait for me" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. "Great costume," they thought, "we'll have to do better next year" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.

Max was a little dog that loved to ride the train. Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty. If Max came home with mud on his fur, Bob would make him sleep outside for the night, but if Max came home clean he would sleep in the house. Max didn't mind sleeping outside, because he could hear the train's whistle and he would dream all night about the train. The funny thing about Max was that he didn't like going for a drive with Bob in a car, on a bike or in a boat. The only way you get Max to go somewhere was on a train.

Sean the dragon liked the color green. He didn't like golden coins. They were too yellow. Every day he would go out and find green things to cover his bed of old treasure. He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried.  When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants.  They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.  One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. "What's that?" he asked.  "That's a green stone," she told him. "Sometimes my treasures have them. I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things."  "If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?" Sean asked. "Yes you can," Zarah said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire."  So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.  Soon Sean had more than enough green stones to cover his bed.  Green stones never got old and brown.  They don't catch fire either.  So, now everyone was happy.

He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.

Jack put some left over pizza in his backpack in case he got hungry. Jack pedaled down his driveway, heading out on his big trip. When he got to the end of his driveway, Mrs. Jones, his teacher from school, was walking by on the sidewalk. "Hello Jack", said Mrs. Jones, "Where are you going on that nice red tricycle?" "I'm going on a trip to someplace far away" said Jack. Mrs. Jones smiled, and thought for a second. "Make sure you are back by morning, we have a field trip tomorrow", said Mrs. Jones.  Jack had been waiting for the field trip for weeks. He looked at Mrs. Jones and said, "I think I'll wait to take a trip until I can fly. I don't want to miss the field trip and this tricycle is not very fast."

There was once an octopus who lived under the ocean. His name was Fred. Fred had never seen the world above the ocean before. He had spent all of his life under water with his friends, a blow fish named Joey, a sponge named Pam, a star fish named Elaine, and another octopus, Stacey. So you can imagine his surprise when he found a treasure chest that had been lost by a ship that had sunk. Inside the chest were things that were completely new to him. Among these was a whole bunch of food items, such as a bottle of ketchup, a coffee mug, a cherry pie, a sandwich, and more. When Fred found these things, he wanted to keep them all for himself. So when he returned to his friends, he didn't tell them what he had found. When his best friend Stacey asked him where he had been, Fred lied and said that he had only gone for a swim. But Stacey didn't believe him. Later on, when Fred was sound asleep in his bed, Stacey visited his room to see what he had been up to. She went digging around in his room for something interesting.

John woke up. It was Tuesday, and he was at home. He was still sleepy, but his alarm clock was ringing and he knew he had to be on time for school. He wished it were Saturday or Sunday. He yawned, got out of bed, and put on his slippers. Then, he walked to the bathroom, where he brushed his teeth and washed his face. Still in his pajamas, he went down to the kitchen. His mother, Sylvia, greeted him with a glass of orange juice and a big bowl of cereal. He was still kind of sleepy, but he drank his juice and ate his cereal. \newline\newlineWhen John was done with his breakfast, he went upstairs and got his school clothes on. Then it was time to catch the bus to school. John hated the bus, because he was quiet and the bus was always loud. Plus there was always some kid who thought it was funny to make gross jokes or say bad words. \newline\newlineToday, John was ready for the bus. With the sandwich and potato chips in his lunchbox, he had some cake he had made yesterday. He had used salt to make the cake instead of sugar. He knew it tasted horrible, and he was going to give a piece of cake to the first person who was bad on the bus, and he didn't even care if he got in trouble.

It was not time to pick the red cherries, or the orange oranges or even the green lettuce, but their nice colors made Jill happy. She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking. A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies. She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour.

Every day at noon, when it was time for recess, Mrs. Snooter would honk a loud horn. This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.\newline\newlineThe students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.\newline\newlineFirst, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.\newline\newlineIf a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.\newline\newlineFinally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students. Most of the time, he was the winner of the race, and would play on the seesaw with his friends.

I once went on a week-long backpacking trip through the mountains. We had a lot of fun and saw a lot of animals. We saw two bears on the first. We also saw one buffalo. During the week we climbed four different mountains. The best day of the trip was the last day. On the last day we heard that one of best things to do was to climb the last mountain at night so that way you could watch the sunrise on top of the mountain. We had to wake up at two in the morning to do the climb. It was very tough to climb a mountain at night. We finally got to the top of the mountain at five in the morning. We watched the sunrise an hour later at six in the morning. It was very beautiful. In fact, at one time because of the rise of the mountain you it was daytime in front of us and nighttime behind us. This was one of the best times in my life.

There once was an alligator named Albert (who wore an office shirt). He had two good friends - Lock the cat and Gary the hamster. Gary often rode around in Albert's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with Albert and Lock as they walked around. One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather. "If we don't get out of this soon, I might die!" yelled Gary, who was cold. "Don't worry, no one's going to die!" yelled Albert, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary. Luckily, they found a house after leaving the forest, which happened to be near the ocean. They ran inside, and dried off, before they headed to sleep.

There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift.

Hunting birds

Sally always loved the ocean. Whenever her parents would talk about going to the beach, she would get so excited that she couldn't sleep the night before. Tonight was one of those nights. As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day. She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, Jared. All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep. In the early hours of the morning, Sally awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear. He was so annoying. A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping Sally and Jared get ready for the day. When everyone was dressed and all of their belongings were packed, the whole family set off for a day of fun in the sun. The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down. After what seemed like hours, Sally spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close! Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. Sally and Jared both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors! Jared always got chocolate, because that was Dad's favorite flavor, too. Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather. Sally couldn't choose. She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out. Finally she chose the shop's special flavor "Tropical Turtle". The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach.

While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter Tina, we saw an ice cream truck pull up on the street. "Can we get ice cream, Nana?" asked Tina. "Sure we can!" I answered. As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. "Nana, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!" Laughing at what was said, I answered, "If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!" Once we reached the ice cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda. "Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?" she asked. "If that is what you want, you sure can!" I answered. We got our food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who Tina knew from her kindergarten class. "Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?" "Let's go!" We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. "That is okay", she said, "Butterflies need to be left out to fly free".  Mary asked Tina if she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead of going home. So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both tired after a long day. We needed to get a good night's sleep to enjoy our camping trip tomorrow.

They found out his name was Henry. Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it. Luckily for Henry Busters mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years Buster knew how to set a broken bone and fix it. After Buster fixed Henry's leg he picked him up and put him on Timmy's back and they all went to the river to get some water. They all were best friends for the rest of their lives and played together.

Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and I don't know what to get him. He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, Tim and Tom, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.\newline\newlineMy mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together.
-  one: What did Tom warn Tim not to get when it comes to gifts?
Any board games
Any item with dinosaurs included
Any item with feathers included
Any toy cars

Jamey really wanted a pet dog, so he went to ask his parents.\newline\newline"Mom, Dad, can I we get a dog?"\newline\newlineJamey's mom and dad thought about this, and then answered him. \newline\newline"Having a pet can be a lot of work, Jamey. When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog."\newline\newlineJamey was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first. \newline\newline"This dog is pretty big, Jamey," his father said. "He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have."  \newline\newlineJamey thought that Dad was right about that. The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog. It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it.\newline\newline"This dog is very noisy Jamey. He might need a lot of attention from you. Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?"\newline\newlineJamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over.\newline\newline"Do you like the brown dog?" asked Jamey's dad.\newline\newline"Yes!" said Jamey. "Can we get him?"\newline\newline"Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?" asked Jamey's mom.\newline\newline"I promise," said Jamey.\newline\newline"In that case, I guess we have a dog!"\newline\newlineThis made Jamey very happy.

Carol said yes and that she would love it if the farmer would give them some. Jake's mouth watered at the thought of eating the golden yellow bananas. They then began walking to the farmer's barn to ask him if they could have some. When they arrived they saw a sign that said the farmer would be out until tomorrow night. He was also a singer and would be performing at a school two towns over in Orangeville.

He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass.\newline\newlineCarefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He didn't know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water. He wanted to help the frog.\newline\newlineHe ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard.\newline\newlineIt took him some time to find the frog again. It seemed to be moving slower than it had before. He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare hands and dropped it into the water.

He set the pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in the stream.

Today was an important day for Sam: he was going to go to the pet store and pick out a pet to take home and live with him! Sam was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him. The pet store had a big, white door and Sam opened it up and heard lots of barking! He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was Chris. Sam said hello and petted the dogs. He really liked one of the dogs named Rocky, but Rocky did not like him. Chris said that Rocky was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice. Sam was a little sad, but he saw the next cage! There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named Button. Sam put his finger through the bars in Button's cage and Button licked his fingers.

Max is a very happy cow. He's dark brown, with big blue eyes, and a soft pink nose.  He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.  During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn. \newline\newlineThe hay isn't as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. "What is this?" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was Omaha, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.  \newline\newline"It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house. \newline\newline"It's so pretty!" Max said. He pushed it with his nose. "Oh! It's so chilly!" He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits. He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer. \newline\newline"Max! What are you doing out here?" The farmer, named Bob, asked. He was loud, but not mad. "It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!" He pushed Max inside the barn, and this time locked the barn door tight.

As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. \newline\newlineThat night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.\newline\newlineThe next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.

There was once a little fairy named Twinkles who lived in an old willow tree. The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, "Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry."\newline\newline"Do not worry," said Twinkles. "I am going to wait here for you until you get back."\newline\newlineWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. "Hmm," thought Twinkles, "I wonder where Betsy went off to." Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.\newline\newlineSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. "Help me! I'm stuck!" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \newline\newline"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.\newline\newline"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck."\newline\newline"No problem," said Twinkles. "That's what friends are for."

Mark, Matthew, Zach and John love to play Football. They did not really care for baseball, basketball or soccer much. They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs. Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings. One day Mark was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day Matthew was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm. Both boys could not play their favorite games now. So to cheer them up, Matthew's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home. When Mark showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers. After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own. So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game. After that they were busy enough to forget their own hurt parts and had a lot of fun that day.

One morning, Daddy, Ethan, and I went out shopping for Mother's day gifts.  First we went to buy some flowers.  I found a nice big bunch of pink roses that were very pretty.  Then we went and bought a card.  There were a lot to choose from, some of them had pictures of kids and some of them had pictures of animals.  Daddy wanted to get one with a kid hugging his mommy but Ethan wanted the one with a cat on it, and I wanted the one with a dog on it.  We ended up getting all three.  Then we went to buy ingredients so we could cook breakfast.  On Mother's day I helped Daddy make breakfast.  We made chocolate pancakes and eggs.  It was very messy but a lot of fun.

It was Saturday and it was nice outside. I did not have school and my mom did not have work. When I woke up we ate breakfast and got ready for the day. My mom started to clean up the house so I went up to my room to play with my toys. My mom came upstairs and told me, "If you clean up your room there is a great surprise in it for you." I was very excited about what the surprise was but not very excited to clean my room. My mom left and closed the door. I looked around and saw how messy my room was. And I really did not want to clean it. So what I did was pick up all my stuff in my room and put it all in my closet. It did not take me very long so I hung out in my room for a little bit longer before heading downstairs to the basement to tell my mom I was ready for my surprise. She came upstairs to see how I did and immediately saw what I did. She was not happy about it. She said, "You either do it right, or Ill do it right and you won't get a surprise." That was enough to make me clean my room right. Finally, my mom told me the surprise when I was all finished. She told me we were going out to the park! But by the time we got there, I could only play for a little bit before it started getting dark. I wished I would have cleaned my room right the first time so I had more time at the park.

Jim wanted to make a fun meal one day. After thinking about it for a long time, he chose to make a chicken dish. Jim made a trip to the store to collect all of the different things he would need to make this meal. He drove his blue truck to the store. On the way he passed a green car, a red van, and a yellow bus. When he got to the store, he met his friends Bob & Mark. He asked if they had seen his friend Joe, but they said no. At the store, Jim bought two pieces of chicken, tomato sauce, cheese, and bread. He drove back to the house, but he saw that something was missing. He had forgotten to grab the bag with the bread in it. He drove back to the store, apologized to the clerk, and grabbed his bag with the bread inside. When he got home, he began to get the food ready. It took him an hour to get the chicken ready to cook and the oven heated up. After that, it took him another hour to cook the food. He had to wait another hour after it was done cooking for his dinner guests to arrive. When they finally arrived, everyone told Jim how wonderful the food tasted, and everyone at the table asked for seconds.

I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me. I was pretty little at the time, so I believed her with no question. It made me think that the bank was important. It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness. I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it.\newline\newlineI didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere.

A rabbit was hopping around, following all the smells he could smell. He had a great nose, smelling carrots, bushes, flowers, and other animals. He smelled melons and he smelled a dish of ice cream. Rabbits don't like ice cream, so he moved to the flowers faster. And he didn't really like to snack on melons either. He saw friends, the duckling and the mother duck, but he was moving too fast to get to the flowers. He could smell the flowers from a long way away. He kept hopping to reach them, faster and faster. One hop, two hops, three hops. On his third hop he always bounced a little higher. He finally smelled the flowers close, so he hopped a little bit faster. The flowers were in sight. He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before. A wonderful smell at last.

On his way, he passed the red house where John lives, the green house where June lives, the white house where Barack lives, the blue hat store, and the orange house where Jessie lives. He finally reached the store at 5 o'clock. \newline\newlineCorky thought about buying some other things too. He looked at the potato chips, but didn't like the flavors they had left. All of the normal flavored ones were gone. He never liked hard candy, so he ignored those. He saw the apples, but didn't need one because he had apples at home. So he picked out some cookies instead. Corky thought he'd eat them on his way home. He waited in line until it was his turn, and then paid Abe the cashier. Abe gave him his change and wished him a good day.\newline\newlineOn his way home, Corky ate his cookies. He had hoped to buy peanut butter cookies, but the store never has those. Instead, he bought sugar cookies. He liked them very much too, so he wasn't at all upset. When he got home, he poured a glass of milk and finished his cookies.

Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap.\newlineA little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.  Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until  Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite.\newlineBilly tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off\newlineOnce Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream. Billy quickly said he wanted the Rocky Road and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'

Under the meat was a slice of dry toast. Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza. Even if it wasn't what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.\newline  \newlineTimmy was bored and wanted something to do, but he didn't have any toys. All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste. He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train. The house was quiet and nighttime was near. He pretended he was camping. It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.  \newline\newlineHe looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful. If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he didn't even have a pencil. \newline\newlineTimmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat. He folded the paper into a mighty ship.   In his imagination the little boat was in a storm on a dark sea. Danger was all around. The imaginary men on his paper boat were facing the storm bravely and sailed into safety as he was falling asleep.

I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel. The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides. My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake. The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it. There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake. Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy. One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot. That cut hurt and made me sad. The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut. Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals. There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers. Their favorite thing to eat is ham. After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream. Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me. Christopher also likes feeding the animals. His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel.

Hannah was so sad! If she had one wish, it would be that she was well enough to go outside and play. The storm last night had brought a lot of snow, she could see it through the window. The snow caused everything to twinkle and shine, like it was colored with a marker made of glitter. What a way to start Christmas break, with the flu making her stuck on the sofa under a blanket. Hannah's brother was getting ready to go outside and enjoy the snow. He put on his jacket and put her hat on his head. He had to wiggle his gloves out of his pocket, but he was nice and warm. From the sofa, Hannah watched her brother play in the snow with his friends and throw snowballs. Her brother tossed a stone at the pond and it broke through the ice with a splash.

"Any of these look good?"\newline\newline"Dad, you know all I want in life is to join the circus! Why can't you let me be myself?"\newline\newlineDad leaned in closer to me, a serious look on his face. "Son, when I was eight I wanted to join the circus too. But when I got to high school, everybody made fun of me. They told me I was dumb for not playing sports and dumb for practicing juggling all day. They told me that nobody would marry me if I didn't give up my circus dreams."\newline\newline"Then how did you find Mom?"\newline\newline"By giving up my dreams of circus juggling and playing football instead! Come on, you'll like it."\newline\newlineI slowly pulled myself out of bed and grabbed the football from Dad's hand. I wanted to make him happy. But I wish he could've been happy with a dream where you didn't get hit with things.

The day was dark and stormy; puddles could be seen all over the ground, making the yard look like a tiny pond.  Conner frowned as he let the curtain drop back down. There was no way that mommy was going to let him go out and play today. She would say that it was too muddy and he would get wet. Conner thought to himself, "But what if I don't ask her?"  Smiling, Conner pushed open the sliding door to the back yard.  Slipping on his rain boots, he rushed outside and began to run and jump from puddle to puddle, sending large showers of water up around him with every jump. After he had jumped in all of the puddles he looked back towards the house to find mommy standing in the doorway watching him with a smile on her face.

I had always had fun playing in the dirt growing up, digging, throwing, building, smashing, everything, so this year for my birthday my mom and dad had bought me a gardening kit to grow my own vegetables. It came with a watering pot, a shovel, a rake and seeds! The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden. We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel, put a seed or two in each hole, and covered them up with dirt and raked over them. Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes. Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten. Every day they would get even bigger. That was the most exciting part! Then they started making little tomatoes, and they sort of looked like grapes. And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red. This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner.

I couldn't believe today had come! It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store. First off, let me say that my name is Lilly, and as I'm sure you know, today's my birthday! Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me. Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets. I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!\newline\newline\tabI arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right. Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day. It was everything I ever hoped and I can't wait for tomorrow!

I once was walking in the woods with my friends. The day was very nice, there were a lot of trees. The walk was part of a week long trip I took with Boy Scouts. This day was day number three of our trip. There was four of us walking. We were walking down a path when all of the sudden we came across a bear. This scared us. Bears can be dangerous. A few seconds later we saw another bear, there was not only one. This bear was a baby bear. A leader told us that a bear with a baby can be much more dangerous. We had to remember what to do when you come across a bear. The leader told us not to walk towards the bear. You also can not make any quick motions. The leader said we needed to start talking to make noise and to start to walk away from the bears. After a little bit of time we were away from the bears and we were safe.

One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach.  We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it. \newline\newlineWe piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no.  I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip. \newline\newlineWhen we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water. \newline\newlineIt felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.\newline\newlineWhen I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.\newline\newlineWhen we got home I was wiped out from playing all day, so I went to sleep almost immediately. It was a very good day that I'll always remember.

So they went down to the mall to buy things for her new house. First she wanted to look for some chairs to go with her table. Then she wanted to find a TV for her living room and a TV for her bedroom. Last she wanted to find a big comfy couch for her living room. When she got to the couch store she had a few different choices. She could buy the biggest couch they had but would go over her limit, it was black. She could buy the middle couch right at her limit, which was brown. Or she could buy the smallest couch well under her limit, but was not a very good color, red. Maria went with the middle couch knowing she would not like the color of the smaller one even if it was least expensive. Maria then had to choose if she wanted them to deliver her couch or if she would pick it up. Knowing she had only a small car she went with the deliver choice.

Maria was a teacher at a small school in Arizona. Maria had worked in the past at schools in California, Texas, and Vermont, but had to leave these schools because the school in Arizona was perfect for her dream job. When she moved to Arizona she found a small little one bedroom house that fit her perfectly. The house was on the top floor of another building, owned by another teacher. In her house was a bed, dresser, table and telephone. Nothing else came with the house. So Maria wanted to go shopping with her new teacher friend. So they went down to the mall to buy things for her new house. First she wanted to look for some chairs to go with her table. Then she wanted to find a TV for her living room and a TV for her bedroom. Last she wanted to find a big comfy couch for her living room. When she got to the couch store she had a few different choices. She could buy the biggest couch they had but would go over her limit, it was black. She could buy the middle couch right at her limit, which was brown. Or she could buy the smallest couch well under her limit, but was not a very good color, red.

Bill's parents, Ned and Susan, came into his room. They told him not to be scared. They said they were going to make sure the car windows were shut and they would be back soon. Bill said okay.

This summer Frank and his friends went to Boy Scout camp for two weeks. At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories. At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.\newline\newlineAt first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys.
