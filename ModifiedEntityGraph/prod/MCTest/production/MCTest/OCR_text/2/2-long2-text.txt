Since the advent of television, social commentators have been evaluating its role in a modern society. In the following excerpt from an essay published in 1992, a German social commentator offers a pointed evaluation of the evaluators. "Television makes you stupid." Virtually all current theories of the medium come down to this simple statement. As a rule, this conclusion is deliv- ered with a melancholy undertone. Four principal theories can be distinguished. The manipulation thesis points to an ideological dimension. It seems in television above all instrument of political domination. The medium is understood as a neutral vessel, which pours out opinions over a public thought of as passive. Seduced, unsuspecting viewers are won over by the wire-pullers, without ever realizing what is happening to them. The imitation thesis argues primarily in moral terms. According to it, television consumption leads above all to moral dangers. Anyone who is exposed to the medium becomes habituated to libertinism, irresponsibility, crime, and violence. The private consequences are blunted, cal- lous, and obstinate individuals; the public consequences are the loss of social virtues and general moral decline. This form of critique draws, as is obvious at first glance, on traditional, bourgeois sources. The motifs that recur in this thesis can be identified as far back as the eighteenth century in the vain warnings that early cultural criticism sounded against the dangers of reading novels. More recent is the simulation thesis. According to it, the viewer is rendered incapable of distinguishing between reality and fiction. The primary reality is rendered unrecog- nizable or replaced by a secondary, phantomlike reality. All of these converge in the stupefaction thesis. According to it, watching television not only undermines the viewer's ability to criticize and differentiate, along with the moral and political fiber of their being, but also impairs their overall ability to perceive. Television produces, there- fore, a new type of human being, who can, according to taste, be imagines as a zombie or a mutant. All these theories are rather unconvincing. Their authors consider proof to be superfluous. Even the minimal criterion of plausibility does not worry them at all. To mention just one example, no one has yet succeeded in putting before us even a single viewer who was incapable of telling the difference between a family quarrel in the current soap opera and one at his or her family's breakfast table. This doesn't seem to bother the advocates of the simulation thesis. Another common feature of the theories is just as curious but has even more serious consequences. Basically, the viewers appear as defenseless victims, the programmers as crafty criminals. This polarity is maintained with great seriouness: manipulators and manipulated, actors and imitators, simulants and simulated, stupefiers and stupefied face one another in a fine symmetry. The relationship of the theorists themselves to television raises some important questions. Either the theorists make no use of television at all (in which case they do not know what they are talking about) or they subject themselves to it, and then the questions arises-through what miracle is the theorist able to escape the alleged effects of television? Unlike everyone else, the theorists has remained completely intact morally, can distinguish in a sovereign manner between deception and reality, and enjoys complete immunity in the face of the idiocy that he or she sorrow- fully diagnoses in the rest of us. Or could-fatal loophole in the dilemma-the theories themselves be symptoms of a universal stupefaction? One can hardly say that these theorists have failed to have any effect. It is true that their influence on what is actually broadcst is severly limited, which may be con- sidered distressing or noted with gratitude, depending on one's mood. On the other hand, they have found ready listeners among politicians. That is not surprising, for the conviction that one is dealing with millions of idiots "out there in the country" is part of the basic psychological equipment of the professional politician. One might have second thoughts about the theorists' influence when one watches how the veterans of televised election campaigns fight each other for every single minute when it comes to displaying their limousine, their historic appearance before the guard of honor, their hairstyle on the platform, and above all their speech organs. The number of broadcast minutes, the camera angles, and the level of applause are registered with a touching enthusiasm. The politicians have been particularly taken by the good old manipulation thesis.
