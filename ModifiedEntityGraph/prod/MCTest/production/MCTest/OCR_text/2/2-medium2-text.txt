This passage is from a book of nature writing published in 1991. In North America, bats fall into mainly predictable categories: they are nocturnal, eat insects, and are rather small. But winging through their lush, green-black world, tropical bats are more numerous and have more exotic habits than do temperate species. Some of them feed on nectar that bat-pollinated trees have evolved to profit from their visits. Carnivorous bats like nothing better than a local frog, lizard, fish, or bird, which they pluck from the foliage or a moonlit pond. Of course, some bats are vampires and dine on blood. In the movies, vampires are rather showy, theatrical types but vampire bats rely on stealth and small, pinprick incisions made by razory, triangular front teeth. Sleeping livestock are their usual victims, and they take care not to wake them. First, they make the classic incisions shaped like quotation marks; then, with saliva full of anti-coagulants so that the victims's blood will flow nicely, they quietly lap their fill. Because this anticoagulant is not toxic to humans, vampire bats may one day play an important role in the treatment of hearth patients - that is, if we can just get over our phobia about them. Having studied them intimately, I now know that bats are sweet-tempered, useful, and fascinating creatures. The long-standing fear that many people have about bats tells us less about bats than about human fear. Things that live by night live outside the realm of ""normal"" time. Chauvinistic about our human need to wake by day and sleep by night, we come to associate night dwellers with people up to no good, people who have the jump on the rest of us and are defying nature, defying their circadian rhythms.* Also, night is when we dream, and so we picture the bats moving through a dreamtime, in which reality is warped. After all, we do not see very well at night; we do not need to. But that makes us nearly defenseless after dark. Although we are accustomed to mastering our world by day, in the night we become vulnerable as prey. Thinking of bats as masters of the night threatens the safety we daily take for granted. Though we are at the top of our food chain, if we had to live alone in the rain forest, say, and protect ourselves against roaming predators, we would live partly in terror, as our ancestors did. Our sense of safety depends on predictability, so anything living outside the usual rules we suspect to be an outlaw, a ghoul. Bats have always figured as frightening or supernatural creatures in the mythology, religion, and superstition of peoples everywhere. Finnish peasants once believed that their souls rose from their bodies while they slept and flew around the countryside as bats, then returned to them by morning. Ancient Egyptians prized bat parts as medicine for a variety of diseases. Perhaps the most mystical, ghoulish, and intimate relationship between bats and humans occurred among the Maya about two thousand years ago. Zotzilaha Chamalcan, their bat god, had a human body but the stylized head and wings of a bat. His image appears often on their altars, pottery, gold ornaments, and stone pillars. One especially frightening engraving shows the bat god with outstretched wings and a question-mark nose, its tongue wagging with hunger, as it holds a human corpse in one hand and the human's heart in the other. A number of other Central American cultures raised the bat to the ultimate height: as god of death and the underworld. But it was Bram Stroker's riveting novel Dracula that turned small, furry mammals into huge, bloodsucking monsters in the minds of English-speaking people. If vampires were semi human, then they could fascinate with their conniving cruelty, and thus a spill of horror books began to appear about the human passions of vampires. *Circadian rhythms are pattern of daily change within one's body that are determined by the time of day or night.
