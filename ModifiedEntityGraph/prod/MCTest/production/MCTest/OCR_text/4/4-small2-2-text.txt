Recently excavated artifacts from Pakistan have inspired a reevaluation of one of the great early urban cultures-the enigmatic Indus Valley civilization, one of the four great early Old World state-cultures, along with Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China's Yellow River civilization. Much less is known about the Indus civilization than these other states because linguists have yet to decipher the Harappan script found on recovered objects. Attempting to understand these vanished people and their social structures, my colleagues and I have drawn clues from the miscellaneous objects we uncover and sites we excavate. In this effort, the Harappan writings have not been totally useless; we have gleaned insights by examining the context of the writing's use.
