In spite of the ridicule that various newspapers aimed at the women's movement. Frederick Douglass continued to lend it his active support. Indeed, few women's rights conventions were held during the 1850's at which Douglass was not a featured speaker and whose proceedings were not fully reported in his paper. Invariably, the notice would be accompanied by an editorial comment hailing the meeting and expressing the editor's hope that it ""will have a powerful effect on the public's mind."" In 1853, when Douglass was considering changing the name of his newspaper, he rejected the proposed title, The Brotherhood, because it ""implied the exclusion of the sisterhood."" He called it Frederick Douglass' Paper, and underneath the title were the words "All Rights For All!" Because women were not permitted to speak at mass meetings of state temperance associations, women in New York formed the Woman's State Temperance Society, with Elizabeth Cady Stanton as president. Douglass supported the society but took issue with the move led by secretary Amelia Bloomer to limit to women the right to hold its offices. He aligned himself with Stanton and Susan B. Anthony in opposing this as a violation of "the principle of human equality"-a violation, in short, of men's rights. Douglass felt that by excluding men from office the society would Jose supporters in the battle against those in the temperance movement who wished to deny women equal rights. How, he asked, could women effectively contend for equality in the movement when they denied it to men? In June 1853, the society accepted the logic of this position and admitted men to office. Douglass learned much from women with ,whom he associated at the national and state women's rights conventions. At one time, he 'had entertained serious doubts about wives being given the right to share equally with their husbands the disposition of property, since ""the husband labors hard"" while the wife might not be earning money. But his discussions with pioneers of the women's rights movement convinced him that even though wives were not paid for their domestic labors, their work was as important for the family as that of their husbands. Once convinced, he acted. He wrote the call for the 1853 convention in Rochester, New York, which demanded not only that women be paid equally with men for their work, but also that women, including married women, have equal rights with men in the ownership and disposition of property. In his newspaper that year, Douglass urged state legislation calling for passage of a law requiring equality in ""the holding: and division of real and personal property,"" One more issue, however, Douglass refused to budge. He was critical of women's rights leaders who addressed audiences from which Black people were barred. His particular target was Lucy Stone. Douglass often praised this abolitionist and veteran fighter for equal rights for women, but he criticized her for not having canceled a lecture in 1853 at Philadelphia's Music Hall when she discovered that Black people would be excluded. Later, be was more severe when he learned that she had invited Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, one of the architects of the infamous Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,2 to join the women who were to meet in Chicago in 1859 to publicize the women's rights cause. Frederick Douglass bluntly accused Stone of willingness to advance women's rights on the, back of ""the defenceless slave woman"" who "has also to bear the ten thousand wrongs of slavery in addition to the common wrongs of woman." Douglass' disputes with some of the women's rights leaders went beyond the question of their appearance before segregated audiences. Women like Stanton and Anthony were close to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. When Douglass split with Garrison over the latter's reliance on words and ""moral suasion"" as the major route to abolition, as well as over Garrison's opposition to antislavery political action, some women's rights leaders grew cool toward Douglass. Although Susan B. Anthony had sided with Garrison, she solicited Douglass' support in her campaign against capital punishment. She circulated a petition for a meeting in 1858 to protest an impending execution and to support a law making life imprisonment the punishment for capital crimes. Long an opponent of capital punishment, Douglass signed the petition, prepared a set of resolutions on the issue, and agreed to take over for the scheduled chair, who had been intimidated by mob violence. Douglass' conduct won over even those women who had allied themselves with Anthony and Garrison. Thus, on the eve of the Civil War, Douglass' relationship with the women's movement was once again cordial. Although this situation was to change after the war, Douglass' influence had helped the women's rights movement become more sensitive to the issue of prejudice against Black Americans. Temperance associations were groups that advocated laws to control the use of alcoholic beverages. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 authorized slaveholders to reclaim runaway slaves.
