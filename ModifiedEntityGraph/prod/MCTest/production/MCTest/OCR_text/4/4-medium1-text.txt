The following is an excerpt from a translation of a novel written in Spanish by an author from Columbia. In a fanciful manner, the novelist portrays the townspeople of an isolated village.Dazzled by so many and such marvelous inventions, the people of Macondo did not know where their amazement began. They stayed up all night looking at the pale electric bulbs fed by the electric plant that Aureliano Trist had brought back when the train made its second trip, and it took time and effort for them to grow accustomed to its obsessive noise.They became indignant over the living images that the prosperous merchant Bruno Crespi projected on the screen in the theater with the lion-head ticket windows, for the character who had died and was buried in one film, and for whose misfortune tears of affliction had been shed, would reappear alive and transformed into an Arab sheik in the next one. The audience, who paid two cents apiece to share the difficulties of the actors, would not tolerate such an outlandish fraud and they broke up the seats. The mayor, at the urging of Bruno Crespi, explained in a proclamation that the cinema was a machine of illusions that did not merit the emotional outbursts of the audience. With that discouraging explanation many felt that they had been the victims of some new trickery and they decided not to return to the movies, considering that they already had too many troubles of their own to weep over the acted-out misfortunes of imaginary beings.Something similar happened with cylinder phonographs brought from France and intended as a substitute for the antiquated hand organs used by the band of musicians. For a time the phonograph records had serious effects on the livelihood of the musicians. At first curiosity increased the business on the street where they were sold and there was even word of respectable persons who disguised themselves as workers in order to observe the novelty of the phonograph at firsthand, but from so much and such close observation they soon reached the conclusion that it was not an enchanted mill as everyone had thought and as some had said, but a mechanical trick that could not be compared with something so moving, so human, and so full of everyday truth as a band of musicians. It was such a serious disappointment that when phonographs became so popular that there was one in every house they were not considered objects for amusement for adults but as something good for children to take apart.On the other hand, when someone from the town had the opportunity to test the crude reality of the telephone installed in the railroad station, which was thought to be a rudimentary version of the phonograph because of its crank, even the most incredulous were upset. It was as if God had decided to put to the test every capacity for surprise and was keeping the inhabitants of Macondo in a permanent alternation between excitement and disappointment, doubt and revelation, to such an extreme that no one knew for certain where the limits of reality lay.
