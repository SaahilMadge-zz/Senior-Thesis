These two passages, written in the 1990's, address the ways in which environmental concerns have been made public.There is nothing wrong with attempting to make the often difficult and complex finding of science available to a wider audience, but environmental popularizers often present a one-sided picture and hide important scientific disagreements on issues relevant to environmental quality. The zeal to draw firm conclusions from the results of scientific research frequently prompts speculative matters to be left out or presented with greater authority than they deserve. The partisanship implicit in these failures is most often excused by the originality of the author's perspective on the subject or a passionate commitment to do good. How could one regret the ""minor"" confusions that might arise from such noble impulses? But using one-sided and incomplete accounts of the state of scientific knowledge has led to projections, predictions, and warnings that, not surprisingly, have been falsified by events. No one knows what the future holds. But reports that Lake Eric and the oceans would be dead by now were surely greatly exaggerated. The United States is wracked neither by food riots nora  great epidemic of pesticide-induced cancers. Birds continue to sing in the mornings, and they do not have to face the rigors of either an ice age caused by humans or a global warming caused by the heat of increased energy production and consumption. With what confidence should we look upon the projected horrors of global warning, rain forest destruction, or toxic waste, given the record of the past? This failure of prophecy may be an intellectual weakness, yet prophecy continues because it provides the popularizers with a  profound rhetorical strength: it releases the power of fear. The central role of this sentiment in political rhetoric has long been understood. Arousing fear, though, is not always easy. Even as far back as Aristotle, it was observed that we fear things less the more distant they are. Hence when Churchill sought to rouse the British, he brought the Germans to the beaches, landing grounds, field, streets, and hills of ""our island."" So, too, to arouse fears the popularizers have to present pictures of imminent calamities that could befall their relatively comfortable and well-off raiders. Environmental disasters like endemic waterborne disease due to inadequate sewage treatment in faraway nations do not fit this category. The prospect of my getting skin cancer due to ozone depletion does. Without such immediacy, one could only arouse a sentiment like compassion, which is not as strong as fear.Few ideas are more deeply entrenched in our political culture than that of impending ecological doom. Beginning in 1962, when Rachel Carson warned readers that pollution was a threat to all life on the planet, pessimistic appraisals of the health of the environment have been issued with increasing urgency. And yet, thanks in large part to her warnings, a powerful political movement was born and a series of landmark environmental bills became law: the Clean Air Act (1970), the Clean Water Act (1972), and the Endangered Species Act (1973). These laws and their equivalents in Western Europe, along with a vast array of private efforts, have been a stunning success. In both the United States and Europe, environmental trends are, for the most part, positive; and environmental regulations, far from being burdensome and expensive, have proved to be strikingly effective, have cost less than was anticipated, and have made the economies of the countries that have put them effect stronger, not weaker. Nevertheless, the vocabulary of environmentalism has continued to be dominated by images of futility, crisis, and decline. In 1988, Thomas Berry, as essayist popular among ecologists, wrote that "the planet cannot long endure present modes of human exploitation."" In 1990, Gaylord Nelson, the former senator from Wisconsin who was a prime mover behind he first Earth Day in 1970, said that environmental problems ""are a greater threat to Earth's life-sustaining systems than a nuclear war." And in 1993 Vice President Al Gore said that the planet now was suffering ""grave and perhaps irreparable damage."" But, at least insofar as the Western world is concerned, this line of thought is an anachronism, rendered obsolete by its own success. Nor are environmentalists the only people reluctant to acknowledge the good news; advocates at both ends of the political spectrum, each side for its own reasons, seem to have tacitly agreed to play it down. The Left is afraid of the environmental good news because it undercuts stylish pessimism; the Right is afraid of the good news because it shows that government regulations might occasionally amount to something other than wickedness incarnate, and actually produce benefits at an affordable cost. This is a bad bargain- for liberals especially. Their philosophy is under siege on many fronts- crime, welfare, medical care, and education, among others. So why not trumpet the astonishing, and continuing, record of success in environmental protection?"
