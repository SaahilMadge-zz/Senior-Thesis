    "First research done with convolutional neural net (Hinton 2012)\n",
    "NEW RESEARCH\n",
    "    - Each layer is differentiable function (potentially non-linear)\n",
    "    - Last layer is softmax and loss is cross-entropy\n",
    "    - Trained by mini-batch SGD\n",
    "    - Several tricks: batch normalization (Ioffe 2015), use ReLU for non-linearities, \n",
    "        several layers of convolutions at multiple scales, max-pooling, full-connect, \n",
    "        GPU for everything, and multiple replicas (50-100) talking to parameter server\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing Words - Classical View\n",
    "    - Classical way is one-hot word vectors (think of this as everything being vertices of the hypercube)\n",
    "        - this way, every pair of words is equally far apart \n",
    "    - Better way is to put them inside the hypercube (word2vec, for example)\n",
    "    - How to get there? Train word embeddings from text corpus\n",
    "        - Online pass over text corpus\n",
    "            - word2vec\n",
    "            - randomly pick a word in the corpus and a nearby word in the text \n",
    "            (like locational nearby, not vector nearby)\n",
    "            - move the corresponding embeddings nearer\n",
    "            - uses skip-gram stuff\n",
    "        - Collect co-occurrence statistics\n",
    "            - GloVe\n",
    "            - Compute pointwise mutual information between words\n",
    "            - Move embeddings to estimate them by dot product\n",
    "\n",
    "Language Modeling with Deep Learning\n",
    "    - Given a sequence of tokens, maximize its joint likelihood p(y_1, y_2, ..., y_T)\n",
    "    - Factorize like this: \\product_t p(y_t | y_1,...,y_{T-1})\n",
    "    - Classical approach: use n-grams to simplify and just count them! \n",
    "        - but this doesn't take into account long-term dependencies and can't generalize to word combos\n",
    "        that can occur frequently but u haven't seen\n",
    "    - Instead: condition on some function h of previous input and use RNNs\n",
    "        \\product_t p(y_t | h_t) with h_t = p (y_t | y_1,...,y_{t-1})\n",
    "        - Here, words are not one-hot encoded but have real word embeddings\n",
    "    - LSTMs work better for our long-term dependencies\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - sequence-to-sequence framework by Sutskever\n",
    "    \n",
    "Image Captioning Experiments\n",
    "    - A recent dataset started it all: MS-COCO dataset\n",
    "        - 75k training images\n",
    "        - 5k evaluation images\n",
    "        - each image has 5 different captions\n",
    "    - Image model Google LeNet(winner of 2014 challenge)\n",
    "    - Caption model is single-layer LSTM with 512 hidden units\n",
    "    - Words have embeddings of size 512\n",
    "    - Small dictionary of 8857 words\n",
    "    - Evaluate results: must compare word counts\n",
    "\n",
    "One More Trick: Scheduled Sampling\n",
    "    - Statistical Machine Translation (same model can be used for image captioning)\n",
    "    - Inference of Sequence Prediction Models with RNNs\n",
    "        - Can use beam search for sampling, but beam size must be small (< 20) for RNNs\n",
    "    - A Sampling approach for training RNNs (sometimes you should show it the true word) instead\n",
    "    of the previous predicted word. i.e. at time t instead of showing sample(t-1) show it true(t-1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - but must be very careful when you do this\n",
    "    \n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "    - Image caption is one more application of the sequence-to-sequence framework\n",
    "    - It is important, during training, to expose the model to diverse situations it can encounter at inference time\n",
    "    - Sampling from the model provides this diversity\n",
    "    - Only sampling from the model during training is too hard\n",
    "    - \"Curriculum learning\" is a reasonable approach to go from completely guided mode towards a \n",
    "    mode that is similar to inference\n",
    "    - Good performance on a few tasks\n",
    "        - for the image caption competition, a few of these models were ensembled and they won!\n",
    "    \n",
